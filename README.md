# 2D_reflector_localization_Algorithm_V1
Official release to implement 2D reflector algorithm and test environment in Matlab
This version includes the refernece reflector pool to update reference reflector pool(size>detected pool) and movement estimation mechanism to reduce the errors caused by fast moving.
